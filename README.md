# German General Personas (GGP)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the German General Personas (GGP) collection!

## Overview

The German General Personas is a unique prompt collection comprising **5,246 distinct personas**. These personas are meticulously constructed from a representative sample of the German population that leverages data from the **ALLBUS (German General Social Survey)**. The ALLBUS is the premier source of information on the attributes and attitudes of the German population that allows us to demonstrate a systematic and principled approach to creating persona prompt collections.

This resource, introduced in our paper "German General Personas: A survey-derived persona prompt collection for population-aligned LLM studies" aims to provide a robust and empirically grounded collection for various applications.

## Why German General Personas?

GGP offers several significant advantages:

1.  **Contextual Information:** Personas enrich language models with relevant contextual information, enabling them to anchor predictions for specific tasks or target variables in empirically observed associations and connections within the German population.
2.  **Representative Alignment:** The ALLBUS is a probability-based survey, and the personas derived from it are designed to represent the German population accurately. While there's growing concern about biased representations in LLMs' survey responses, GGP can potentially help align LLMs more effectively with the demographics and attitudes of the German population.
3.  **Novel Resource:** GGP stands as a novel textual resource for researchers and practitioners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science (CSS).
